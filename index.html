            My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until Ifound
            out he was going to die. That it was going to happensoon. That it
            was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.Things I hadn't
            thought about for a long time. I guess I kindof took him for granted
            or something. I mean, our parents arejust always there. You expect
            them to always be bugging youto clean up your room or study harder
            or have good manners ortry new things to grow up to be a more
            well-rounded person oneday. And make you get up early on the weekend
            to have"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive
            mecrazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different sinceDad
            got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in thenear future,
            he might not be around to drive me crazy.
          </p>
          <p class="mini">
            Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally
            hate thatquestion) or nags me about coming home on time at night and
            being respon-sible. One day he won't be here to ask. Now I feel
            lucky when I hearhis car pulling into the driveway after school. I
            even like to hear him cough-ing. It means he's still around. Still
            my dad.

            My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's
            annoyingly smart.I mean, super brainiac annoying. He knows the most
            random stuff. Likehow at room temperature, mercury is the only metal
            that is in liquid form.And water expands as it drops in temperature,
            and by the time it's frozen ittakes up about 9% more space. Or that
            if you slowly pour a handful of saltinto a totally full glass of
            water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water levelwill go down. He's
            always dropping the little facts about everything. Hedoesn't realize
            what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.I
            think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is. He likes
            to cookbecause of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he
            says chemi-cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's
            always explaining as hegoes. I don't take his class at school but I
            hear he's a pretty good teacher.He gets a lot of practice at home,
            that's for sure.
          </p>

            The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've
            always had tohear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr
            White's kid.(Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name
            of the totally losershoes he always wears). Some kids dissed him
            just to get on my nerves.Some kids just dissed him period because
            that's what you do with teachers.The thing is though, he expects
            everyone to do their best just like he does,and when you don't try
            your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That'show he is at home
            and at school. I only just figured out what a good qual-ity that is.
            That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and whatmade me
            brave, too when I was younger. Whether I wanted to be or not.Anyway,
            I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because
            ofmy dad being a teacher there I was different. I realize two things
            now.First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a
            done deal.And two, he's the right dad for me. I can't do a lot of
            physical stuff be-cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad
            and it wouldn't be with alot of other dads I've met. They'd be
            disappointed because they're intosports or whatever. I mean, my dad
            doesn't have a disability but you surewouldn't want to see him throw
            a football. So in that way, we get along. Itmakes sense that he's my
            dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't careabout what the kids at
            school say anymore. The bottom line is he's a goodteacher and no one
            can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know hecares. After
            our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves thebest. I
            really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to
            dofor a long time. For him, for his students, and for me and my
            family.

            It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer.
            Notthat there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary
            as that,but it was sure a bad time for us. My mom was pregnant with
            what she callsa surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though
            she's a newborn baby she'sactually cute) and my dad had an extra job
            after school to try to help payall the regular bills. And that was
            before he got his diagnosis. We don'thave a lot of money but we were
            doing okay until all the medical bills. Andmy dad is pretty proud -
            okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-ity. That's why
            I'm doing this. Not because I want to make him mad orupset, but
            because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.

            One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more
            than aregular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the
            best ones) don'ttake insurance. I think that's wrong. I mean, one of
            the big reasons whymy dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the
            first place was because hedidn't want to leave us behind with a huge
            debt. That's the thing about mydad - he loves us more than anything.
            More than himself. But we want himaround and we want him to try
            everything he can to stay with us as long aspossible. This surgery
            is the one chance there is to save his life. And wecan't afford it.
            And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have withhim. And I
            don't want to tell my little sister about my dad. I want her toknow
            him for herself.
